# moneylog
The github repository for my WPF application to track your personal spendings! 

# Starting point
Eventhough there are different finance tracking applications online, many of them are not free and not necessarily easy to use. So I wanted to create an application that lifts those barriers and allows for quick and easy tracking of your own personal expenses.

# Goal
As mentioned above, the base idea was to create an easy to use desktop application, that allows the user to insert all of their expenses and give them a simple overview of their spendings. The interface needed to be simple and generally ergonomic.

# The Creation
This project is what I created during the 4th Semester at the IMS, in which I attended the Module 120, a module that covers the development of user friendly and ergonomic user interfaces. The goal of this project was therefore, as one can probably reckon, to create a desktop application using the .NET framework by Microsoft, which uses C#. We set off with an empty canvas and were taught many vital things about ergonomic and user centered design procedures. The responsible for this module and concurrently our teacher then gave us certain goals we had to achieve - a set of 6 groups, each covering a certain stage of the development process. Which goals we wanted to pursue was up to us, so we did not necessarily have to force ourselves to work on something we did not fully believe in. Besides that, this also explains the several commits seen under the "Commits" tab that reference goals or milestones.
