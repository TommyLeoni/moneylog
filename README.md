# moneylog
The github repository for my WPF application to track your personal spendings! 

# Starting point
Eventhough there are different finance tracking applications online, many of them are not free and not necessarily easy to use. So I wanted to create an application that lifts those barriers and allows for quick and easy tracking of your own personal expenses.

# Goal
As mentioned above, the base idea was to create an easy to use desktop application, that allows the user to insert all of their expenses and give them a simple overview of their spendings. The interface needed to be simple and generally ergonomic.

# The Creation
